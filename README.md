# iter
An iterator library for Zig.

This started out as a toy project to gain more familiarity with Zig, and when I initially started on this project, I thought I would be finished within a day, and ended up spending more than a week on it. The interface in this library is the exact same as the interface on the Rust Iterator trait, and all the functions behave in the same way.

## Goals
- [x] iterator chain calling
    - ```it.take(10).chain(other).drop(3)```
- [x] zero heap allocation
- [x] simple interface
- [x] not too much internal boilerplate
- [ ] implement the functions of the Rust Iterator trait where applicable
  - Functions such as `.cloned()` or `.clone()` do not really make sense in the context of Zig, as it does not have a concrete way to determine whether or not something can be cloned

## Stable

- [ ] cloned
- [ ] cmp
- [x] collect
- [ ] copied
- [x] count
- [ ] enumerate
- [ ] eq
- [x] filter
- [ ] filter_map
- [ ] find
- [ ] find_map
- [ ] flat_map
- [ ] flatten
- [x] fold
- [x] for_each
- [ ] fuse
- [ ] ge
- [ ] gt
- [ ] inspect
- [ ] last
- [ ] le
- [ ] lt
- [x] map
- [ ] map_while
- [ ] max
- [ ] max_by
- [ ] max_by_key
- [ ] min

- [ ] partial_cmp
- [ ] partition
- [ ] peekable
- [ ] position

- [x] reduce
- [ ] rev
- [ ] rposition
- [ ] scan
- [ ] size_hint
- [x] skip
