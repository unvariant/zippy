# iter
An iterator library for Zig.

This started out as a toy project to gain more familiarity with Zig, and when I initially started on this project, I thought I would be finished within a day, and ended up spending more than a week on it. The interface in this library is the exact same as the interface on the Rust Iterator trait, and all the functions behave in the same way.

## Goals
- [x] iterator chain calling
    - ```it.take(10).chain(other).skip(3)```
- [x] zero heap allocation
- [x] simple interface
- [x] not too much internal boilerplate
- [ ] implement the functions of the Rust Iterator trait where applicable
  - Functions such as `.cloned()` or `.clone()` do not really make sense in the context of Zig, as it does not have a concrete way to determine whether or not something can be cloned

## Performance
I have not tried to profile this library at all (although I am planning to soon I swear), so I can not make any guarantees about performance.
